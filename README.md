I improved the program by taking the div tags and replaced them 
with more descriptive tags. Afterward, I fixed the Search Engine 
Optimization link in the navbar that wasn't working.
In the CSS I removed many of the redundancies, All of the 
changes are commented on in the CSS file.
finally, I added a reset CSS file to make the website appear 
more uniform on all desktops.
